        "Here is a list of indicators from the United States Census Bureau that could potentially affect microbusiness activity across the United States counties:\n",
        "\n",
        "Household income: Higher household income levels may be correlated with higher levels of microbusiness activity, as consumers with more disposable income may be more likely to purchase goods and services from small businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Educational attainment: Counties with higher levels of educational attainment may be more conducive to small business growth, as individuals with higher levels of education may be more likely to start their own businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access to broadband: Access to high-speed internet is essential for many small businesses. Counties with higher levels of access to broadband may be more attractive to small business owners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Information technology employment: Counties with a higher proportion of the workforce employed in information technology industries may be more likely to have a thriving small business sector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Foreign-born population: Counties with a higher proportion of foreign-born residents may be more likely to have a diverse array of small businesses, as immigrants are often overrepresented among small business owners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Population density: Counties with higher population densities may have a larger customer base for small businesses to tap into.\n",
        "\n",
        "Age distribution: Counties with a younger population may be more likely to have higher levels of microbusiness activity, as younger individuals are often more likely to start their own businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business ownership rate: Counties with a higher rate of business ownership may be more conducive to small business growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Industrial composition: Counties with a diverse industrial composition may be more likely to have a thriving small business sector, as small businesses often serve as suppliers to larger industries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median age: Counties with a younger median age may be more likely to have higher levels of microbusiness activity, as younger individuals are often more likely to start their own businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median household size: Counties with larger households may be more likely to support small businesses, as there may be more potential customers within a single household.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median home value: Counties with higher median home values may be more attractive to small business owners, as higher home values may be correlated with higher levels of disposable income among residents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median gross rent: Counties with higher median gross rent may be more expensive for small businesses to operate in, which could impact the overall level of microbusiness activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent burden: Counties with a higher proportion of renters who are \"rent burdened\" (i.e. spending a large portion of their income on rent) may be less attractive to small business owners, as consumers may have less disposable income to spend on goods and services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vacancy rate: Counties with a high vacancy rate may be less attractive to small business owners, as there may be less demand for goods and services in areas with a high number of empty properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transportation: Counties with good transportation infrastructure (e.g. access to major roads, public transit options) may be more attractive to small business owners, as it may be easier for customers to access their businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Land use: Counties with a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial land use may be more conducive to small business growth\n",
        "\n",
        "Population growth: Counties with a growing population may be more likely to have a thriving small business sector, as a larger population can provide a larger customer base for small businesses to tap into.\n",
        "\n",
        "Labor force participation: Counties with a high labor force participation rate may be more conducive to small business growth, as a larger pool of available workers can provide a larger pool of potential employees for small businesses to hire from.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unemployment rate: Counties with a low unemployment rate may be more attractive to small business owners, as there may be a larger pool of available workers to hire from.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median travel time to work: Counties with shorter median travel times to work may be more attractive to small business owners, as employees may be more likely to work in businesses that are closer to their homes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median commute time: Counties with shorter median commute times may be more attractive to small business owners, as shorter commute times can make it easier for employees to access their workplaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Occupation distribution: Counties with a diverse occupational structure may be more conducive to small business growth, as small businesses often serve as suppliers to larger industries.\n",
